      When I was six years old, I saw an amazing picture in a book. It was a
      picture of a snake that was eating a big animal. Here is a copy of the
      drawing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In the book it said, “Snakes eat the whole animal. Then they are not
      able to move. And they sleep for six months.”
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought a lot about the adventures in the jungle. Then I made my
      first drawing. I did it with a coloured pencil. My drawing number one
      looked like this.

      I showed my great drawing to the adults, and I asked them if my
      drawing scared them.
    </p>
    <p>But they answered, “Why should anyone be scared of a hat?”</p>
    <p>
      My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a big snake
      with an elephant inside. I then drew the inside of the big snake, so
      that the adults could understand. They always need explanations. My
      drawing number two looked like this.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The adults advised me to stop drawing snakes, from the inside or the
      outside. They advised me to be interested more in geography, history,
      maths and grammar. That’s why, at the age of six, I left an amazing
      career as a painter. I did it because my picture number one and
      picture number two were not successful when adults saw them. Adults
      never understand anything alone, and it is <strong>tiring</strong> for
      children to always give them explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I had to choose another profession and I learnt to fly planes. I
      flew all over the world. And it’s true geography was very useful to
      me. I can recognise China from Arizona at first look. It is very
      useful if you are lost at night.

      <p>
        During my life, I had lots of contact with many serious people. I
        lived a lot among the adults. I could see them from a close
        distance. It did not really improve my opinion of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I met an adult who seemed to me a little normal, I tried a
        little experiment. I showed him or her my drawing number one which I
        always had on me. I wanted to know if this was a person of true
        understanding. But the person always said, “It’s a hat.” Then I
        never spoke to this person about big snakes or forests or stars. I
        went to his or her level and I talked about bridges, golf, politics
        and <strong>ties</strong>. And the adult was
        <strong>glad</strong> to know such a reasonable man.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I lived alone, without anyone who I could really talk to, until I
        had an accident in the Sahara Desert. It was six years ago.
        Something was broken in my engine. I didn’t have any mechanic or any
        passenger in the plane with me. I was preparing to do the difficult
        repair job by myself. It was a question of life or death for me. I
        had only enough drinking water for a week.

    The first night I <strong>fell</strong>
    <strong>asleep</strong> on the sand a thousand miles
    from any land with people. I was more isolated than a
    sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. So you can
    imagine my surprise when a funny little voice woke me up
    in the morning. It said, “Please, draw me a sheep!”
  </p>
  <p>“What?”</p>
  <p>“Draw me a sheep!”</p>
  <p>
    I jumped to my feet as if I was hit by lightning. I
    <strong>rubbed</strong> my eyes. I looked around. And I
    saw a very unusual little man who was looking at me very
    seriously. This is the best picture which I later
    managed to make of him.

  <p>
    But my drawing, of course, is much less fascinating than
    the original model. It’s not my fault. I was discouraged
    in my career as a painter by the adults at the age of
    six. And I never learnt to draw anything, except snakes
    from the outside and snakes from the inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    I looked at this figure with my eyes full of surprise.
    Don’t forget that I was a thousand miles from any land
    with people. And yet this little man didn’t seem to be
    tired, hungry, thirsty or scared. He didn’t look like a
    child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles
    from any land with people.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I finally managed to speak, I said to him, “What
    are you doing here?”
  </p>
  <p>
    He repeated, very slowly and very seriously, “Please
    draw me a sheep.”
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <div >
    <p>
      The whole situation was very strange but I took a sheet
      of paper and a pen out of my pocket. But then I
      remembered that I mostly studied geography, history,
      maths and grammar, and I told the little man that I did
      not know how to draw.
    </p>
    <p>He replied, “It doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep.”</p>
    <p>
      “But I have never drawn a sheep. How can I draw one
      now?” I thought to myself. So I drew him one of two
      drawings which I was able to draw. It was a big snake
      from the outside. And I was shocked to hear the little
      man reply, “No, no, no! I don’t want an elephant inside
      a big snake. A big snake is a very dangerous
      <strong>creature</strong>, and an elephant takes a lot
      of space. Where I live, everything is very small. I need
      a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I made a drawing. He looked at it carefully, then he said, “No. This sheep is already very ill. Make me another.”
    </p>
  
    <p>So I made another drawing.  My friend smiled gently at me, “You have to see it too.
      This isn’t a sheep. It’s a <strong>ram</strong>. It has
      <strong>horns</strong>.”</p>

    <p>So then I made another drawing.  But it was <strong>rejected</strong> too, just like the
      others. “This one is too old. I want a sheep who will live a
      long time.”  Then, for lack of patience, because I was in a hurry to
      start repairing my engine, I quickly drew this drawing.  And I said, “That’s a box. The sheep you want is
      inside.”</p>

    <p>
      I was very surprised to see the face of my young
      <strong>judge</strong> get lighter, “That’s exactly how
      I wanted it! Do you think the sheep will need a lot of
      grass?“ “Why?” “Because where I live, everything is very small.”There will surely be enough grass for it. I gave you a
      very small sheep.“  He <strong>bent</strong> his head over the drawing, “Not
      so small. Look! The sheep has gone to sleep.” And that is how I met the little prince.

    It took me a long time to understand where he came from.
    The little prince, who asked me many questions, never
    seemed to hear mine. But as he was speaking, step by
    step everything was shown to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, when he first saw my plane, he asked,
    “What’s that thing?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “That isn’t a thing. It flies. It’s a plane. It‘s my
    plane.”
  </p>
  <p>And I was proud to tell him that I could fly.</p>
  <p>Then he shouted, “What! You fell from the sky?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” I said not very loudly.</p>
  <p>“Oh! That’s funny!”</p>
  <p>
    And the little prince started to laugh very loudly,
    which made me very angry. People should take my bad
    situation seriously.

</div>
<div
class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"

<div class="et_pb_text_inner">
  <p>
    Then he added, “So you also fell from the sky like me.
    What planet are you from?”
  </p>
  <p>
    At that moment I started to understand a little bit more
    about him, and I questioned him quickly, “Do you come
    from another planet?”
  </p>
  <p>
    But he didn’t answer me. He only moved his head gently.
    He kept looking at my plane.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Of course, on that thing you couldn’t come from very
    far.”
  </p>
  <p>
    And he started to think deeply. It lasted a long time.
    Then he took his sheep out of his pocket, and he got
    lost in observing it.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    You can imagine how my <strong>curiosity</strong>
    <strong>increased</strong> when I
    <strong>learnt</strong> about the other planets. I
    decided to learn more.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Where do you come from? Where is your home? Where do
    you want to take your sheep?”
  </p>
  <p>
    After a long silence he answered, “The good thing about
    the box is that at night it will
    <strong>serve</strong> as a house for the sheep.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Of course. And if you are good, I’ll also give you a
    <strong>rope</strong>, so that you can tie the sheep
    during the day.”
  </p>
  <p>
    But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer, “Tie
    the sheep. What a funny idea!”
  </p>
  <p>
    “But if you don’t tie the sheep, it will run away. It
    will get lost.”
  </p>
  <p>My friend started to laugh loudly again.</p>
  <p>“But where do you think the sheep would go?”</p>
  <p>“Anywhere. Straight ahead.”</p>
  <p>
    Then the little prince said seriously, “Even if the
    sheep went away, it doesn’t matter. Where I live,
    everything is so small.” And, with a little sadness, he
    added, “Straight ahead, nobody can go very far.”

  <p>
    So, this way, I learnt a second very important thing.
    The planet <strong>that</strong> the little prince came
    from was hardly bigger than a house.
  </p>
  <p>
    But that didn’t really surprise me much. I knew very
    well that we don’t only have planets like Earth,
    Jupiter, Mars, and Venus, which have names. There are
    also hundreds of others that are sometimes so small that
    it’s difficult to see them through the telescope. When
    an astronomer discovers one of them, he doesn’t give it
    a name, but only a number. He calls it, for example,
    Asteroid 3251.

  <p>
    I have serious reason to believe that the planet from
    which the little prince came is Asteroid B-612.
  </p>
  <p>
    This asteroid was seen only once through the telescope.
    That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
  </p>

  <p>
    He made a great <strong>demonstration</strong> of his
    discovery at the International Astronomical Congress.
    But nobody believed him because he was wearing Turkish
    clothes. Adults are like that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a
    Turkish leader made a <strong>law</strong>, under
    penalty of death, that people should dress like
    Europeans. The astronomer made his demonstration for the
    second time in 1920.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was wearing a very elegant <strong>suit</strong>. And
    this time everybody accepted his news.

    I am telling you these details about Asteroid B-612 and
    I am telling you its number because adults like numbers.
    When you tell them that you have a new friend, they
    never ask you questions about important things. They
    never ask you, “What does his voice sound like? What
    games does he prefer? Does he collect butterflies?” They
    ask, “How old is he? How many brothers does he have? How
    much does he weigh? How much money does his father
    make?” Only from these numbers they think that they have
    learnt anything about him.

    birds on the roof,” they can’t imagine the house. You
    have to say to them, “I saw a house that cost one
    hundred thousand dollars.” Then they would say, “That’s
    a pretty house.”
  </p>
  <p>
    So if you say to the adults, “The proof that the little
    prince existed is that he was cute, that he laughed, and
    that he wanted a sheep. If you want a sheep, it’s proof
    that you exist,” it won’t help them. They will shake
    their heads, and <strong>treat</strong> you like a
    child. But if you tell them, “The planet he came from is
    Asteroid B-612,” then they will be
    <strong>convinced</strong>. And they won’t ask you any
    questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    They’re like that. We <strong>mustn’t</strong> blame
    them. Children should be very patient
    <strong>towards</strong> adults.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, of course, we who understand life, we don’t care
    about numbers. We like to tell a story like a
    <strong>fairy</strong> <strong>tale</strong>. We like to
    say, “<strong>Once</strong> <strong>upon</strong>
    <strong>a</strong> <strong>time</strong> there was a
    little prince who lived on a planet hardly bigger than
    himself, and who needed a friend.” For those who
    understand life, it would sound much truer.
